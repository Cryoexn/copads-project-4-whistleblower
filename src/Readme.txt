    ============= Feedback ============================

    How many hours in total did you spend on this assignment?

        Include reading time, research time, coding time, AND test/debug time.

        10 hours.


    What did I learn?

        How basic RSA public private key encryption works.


    What was easy about this assignment?

        Implementing the OAEP encoding and RSA encryption.


    What gave you trouble? Describe specific problems, you had, if any.

        I had trouble with the sending of encrypted message in byte array form.
        I wasn't using a buffer byte array when sending the bytes through the DatagramSocket.


    What can the instructor do to improve this assignment?

        Not much really. It was very straight forward. I just had an issue with using DatagramSocket/DatagramPacket
        so possibly a little more information about those components.


    Would you have liked to add or do anything further?

        Very informative project and really satisfying once it was working.
